# comp2209 haskell coursework

## Introduction
This project is made up of six problems, 

containing interpreting, translating, analysing and parsing a variation of the lambda calculus. 

Haskell is needed to solve this functional programming challenge.

## Evaluation
This assignment received a score of 35/40,

with the second question scoring 3/5,

because the second question was not exactly a solution to the Eight Queens problem.

The rest of the ideas are basically correct.
